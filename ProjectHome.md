A simple compiler for **TestTag**: A test case description language.

This compiler generates a XML file that can be imported on [Testlink](http://www.teamst.org/) an Open Source Test Management Tool.

Although very useful for test management, the test case creation, planning and reuse part of Testlink has a lot of things to improve. Using any text editor and this simple language, on the other hand, you can dramatically improve productivity and test case reuse.
