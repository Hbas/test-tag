#summary User Stories Part 3: Other topics
In this section we will show user stories which describes the use of Comments and multiple files with the same suite name.

= Part 3: Other topics =
== Comments ==
User stories:
   * A single line that starts with the token '//' is a comment

Example:
{{{
suite name {
  test case name {
    //this is a single line comment
    Step => Expected result
  }
}
}}}

== Using a tag outside a suite ==
* A tag can be outside a suite
* A tag outside a suite can be used on any file

Example
file1 code:
{{{
TAG: empty { }
suite name {
   testcase (empty ) {
    Step => Expected result
  }
}
}}}

file2 code:
{{{
suite2 {
   testcase (empty) {
    Step => Expected result
  }
}
}}}

== Using multiple files ==
* If the same suite name is used in multiple files, it will be threated as the same suite

Example:
file1 code:
{{{
suite name {
   testcase1 (empty ) {
    A sample step => The expected result
  }
}
}}}

file2 code:
{{{
suite name {
   testcase2 (empty ) {
    A sample step => The expected result
  }
}
}}}
