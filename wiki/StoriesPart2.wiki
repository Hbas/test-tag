#summary User Stories Part 2: Tags and reuse
= User Stories Part 2: Tags and reuse (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET) =
In this section we will show how to use "tags" (or labels) to reuse steps and preconditions

== Defining a tag ==

User stories:
  * An element that starts with the token "TAG:" is a tag
  * A tag can be inside a suite
  * A tag can have preconditions
  * A tag donÂ´t need to have steps

{{{
suite name {
  TAG: sample tag {
    PRE: All test cases that have this tag will also have this precondition
  }
}
}}}

== Using a tag ==
User stories:
  * A test case can have zero or more tags
  * A tag can have zero or more tags

Example:
{{{
suite name {
  TAG: tag1 {
    PRE: All test cases that have this tag will also have this precondition
  }
  TAG: tag2 (tag1) {
    PRE: Another precondition
  }
  testcase (tag2) {
    Step => Expected result
  }
}
}}}

This example is equivalent to:
{{{
suite name {
  testcase {
    PRE: All test cases that have this tag will also have this precondition    
    PRE: Another precondition
    Step => Expected result
  }
}
}}}

== A tag with steps ==

User stories:
  * A tag can have zero or more steps that should be added before the current test steps
  * A tag can have zero or more steps that should be added after the current test steps
  * Tags are applied in the order they are called on the test case

Example:
{{{
suite name {
  TAG: logout {
    PRE: The user must be logged
    AFTER: Click on logout => The system closes the window
  }

  TAG: check name{
    AFTER: Click on "Home" => The system returns to the initial screen
  }

  TAG: open the menu{
    BEFORE: Open the menu => The system displays the requested screen
  }

  testcase (check name, open the menu, logout) {
    Step => Expected result
  }
}
}}}

This example is equivalent to:
{{{
suite name {
  testcase {
    PRE: The user must be logged
    Open the menu => The system displays the requested screen
    Step => Expected result
    Click on "Home" => The system returns to the initial screen
    Click on logout => The system closes the window
  }
}
}}}
